## ğŸ“– Summary
This project implements and analyzes a **dual-switch non-inverting buck-boost converter** for LED and fluorescent lighting applications.

- Converter designed to work in **Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM)**.  
- Controlled using **PWM regulation** and a **Type-III rational controller**.  
- Ensures compatibility with both **LED drivers** and **electronic ballasts**.  
- Simulated and validated in **MATLAB Simulink**.

## âš¡ Features
- Buck mode: step-down when input > load voltage.  
- Boost mode: step-up when input < load voltage.  
- Buck-Boost mode: automatic switching between buck & boost.  
- Efficient and stable across varying load conditions.
